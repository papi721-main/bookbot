BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Description

BookBot is a simple Python script that reads a .txt file and prints out basic statistics such as the total number of words, the total number of characters, and the frequency of each word. It's designed as a beginner-friendly project to help understand file handling, string processing, and dictionary operations in Python.
